Analyze energy consumption for Building A today and provide recommendations for reducing energy costs. Also forecast the peak load for the next 24 hours.

Expected behavior:
1. The Supervisor should detect multiple intents:
   - "building_energy_analysis" (from "Analyze energy consumption")
   - "energy_saving_recommendations" (from "recommendations for reducing")
   - "peak_load_forecasting" (from "forecast the peak load")

2. The Supervisor should route to SmartCampusEnergyAgent since it has all these capabilities.

3. The agent should execute the building_energy_analysis task first, then use that data to generate recommendations, and finally provide a forecast.

4. The response should include:
   - Total consumption for Building A today
   - Peak consumption hour
   - Energy saving recommendations with estimated savings
   - 24-hour peak load forecast with predicted consumption values

Sample expected output structure:
{
  "agent": "SmartCampusEnergyAgent",
  "capability": "building_energy_analysis",  // Primary capability detected
  "response": {
    "status": "SUCCESS",
    "results": {
      "data": {
        "building_id": "Building-A",
        "date": "2025-11-22",
        "total_consumption_kwh": 1250.5,
        "peak_hour": 14,
        "average_consumption_kwh": 52.1
      },
      "explainability": [
        "Analyzed 24-hour consumption data for Building-A on 2025-11-22",
        "Total consumption: 1250.5 kWh",
        "Peak consumption occurred at 14:00",
        "Trend analysis indicates stable consumption pattern"
      ],
      "ltm_hit": false
    }
  }
}

Note: In a full implementation, the Supervisor might handle multi-intent queries by making multiple sequential calls to the agent or by implementing a composite task capability.
